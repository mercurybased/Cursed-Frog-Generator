# Cursed Frog Generator

## Description

We wanted to create a fun interactive application that the user can make a choice between a funny joke, an inspirational quote, or a fun fact, accompanied by a randomly generated frog gif.

## Usage

Simply click the "Choose Your Wisdom" button and make a selection between a funny joke, an inspirational quote, or a fun fact. Once the user has made a selection, the text corresponding to their choice will immediately populate on screen, followed by an accompanying gif of a random frog. User can endlessly populate more wisdoms by simply clicking the "Choose Your Wisdom" button again and again.
